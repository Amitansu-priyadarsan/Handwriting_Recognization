Here’s an updated README incorporating the IAM Handwritten Forms Dataset from Kaggle and a few additional features:

# ✍️ Handwriting Recognition System

This project implements a handwriting recognition system that processes handwritten text and converts it into digital text using **machine learning** and **image processing** techniques.

## 🌟 Features

- 📝 Handwritten text input via image upload
- ✂️ Image preprocessing (grayscale conversion, noise reduction, etc.)
- 🤖 Character recognition using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
- ⏱️ Real-time display of recognized text
- 🔄 Option to retrain the model with a custom dataset
- 📊 Accuracy tracking for each recognition session
- 🌐 Supports multiple languages for recognition (depending on dataset used)

## 📂 Dataset

This project uses the [IAM Handwritten Forms Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/naderabdalghani/iam-handwritten-forms-dataset) for training and testing.

### IAM Handwritten Forms Dataset:

- The dataset consists of scanned handwritten forms from over 600 writers.
- It contains more than 1,500 handwritten text samples.
- Suitable for both character-level and word-level recognition.

You can replace or modify the dataset in the `data/` directory to improve or customize recognition accuracy.

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

- 🐍 Python 3.x
- 📦 Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Handwriting-Recognition.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Handwriting_Recognization-master
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/naderabdalghani/iam-handwritten-forms-dataset) and place it in the `data/` directory.

5. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## 🖥️ Usage

1. **Upload handwritten image** via the interface.
2. The system preprocesses the image (converts to grayscale, removes noise).
3. **Recognition**: The CNN model recognizes handwritten characters.
4. The recognized text is **displayed in real-time**.
5. (Optional) **Retrain the model** with your custom dataset if desired.

## 🧠 Model

The handwriting recognition model is built using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. The CNN processes preprocessed images to convert them into text.

- You can retrain the model using a new dataset in the `data/` directory.
- The model can be customized for different languages depending on the training data.

## ⚙️ Additional Features

- **Multilingual Support**: Extend the model for recognizing handwritten text in multiple languages (dataset dependent).
- **Customizable Training**: Ability to replace or add datasets to improve recognition accuracy.
- **Accuracy Tracking**: Track the accuracy of recognition in each session, providing feedback on model performance.
- Dataset sourced from [IAM Handwritten Forms Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/naderabdalghani/iam-handwritten-forms-dataset).
